<blockquote>
And even that insanely curious data scientist, if he or she insists on working alone, won’t be able to produce the most valuable insights. Those come from high-performing teams combining individuals who are individually curious and naturally creative, but also collaborative in their approach to the art and science of experimentation. A great data science team is like a jazz quartet, where individuals are always riffing off of one another, and each takes the music to a new and unexpected place.

I'm a big believer in heterogeneous teams and I thrive when working alongside people with different education, background and experience. I think that Sullivan's simile above is extremely apt.

Thanks to [@rlnel](https://twitter.com/rlnel) who pointed me to [this article](http://businessoverbroadway.com/investigating-data-scientists-their-skills-and-team-makeup) which expresses similar sentiments.

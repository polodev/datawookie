It seems a little counter-intuitive, but a 5 minute lightning talk is far more difficult to prepare (and present!) than a standard 20 minute or longer talk. The principle challenge is fitting everything that you want to say into the allotted time, while still maintaining an engaging narrative.

At the recent [satRday conference in Cape Town](http://capetown2018.satrdays.org/) (17 March 2018) we had a number of great lightning talks.  A few of the speakers gave us their tips on creating a brilliant lightning talk.

- **Have a strong hook.** You don't have a moment to lose! You need to grab the audience's attention from the moment you take the stage.
- **Don’t sweat the small stuff.** Avoid getting bogged down in the details. You only have time to present the big picture, the core of the idea. Provide references to a repository with further information and encourage people to contact you if they want to know more.
- **No more than 5 slides of content.**
- **Be sparing with text.** Don't burden yourself (or the audience) with slides full of text.
- **Focus on a single idea (or at most 2 or 3).**
- **Less is more.** One slide = one thought.
- **Know your target audience.** It's difficult to cater for an audience with a diverse range of expertise. You can take one of two approaches: try to cater for everybody or target a specific niche. The latter approach is probably best. If you lose some people along the way it's not a big deal: you'll be done in 5 minutes and they'll bounce back.
- **Don't talk too quickly.**
- **Use visualisations.** Design them carefully so that their interpretation is self-evident and you won't need to spend time explaining them.
- **Use images, animations and funny GIFs.** You're there to inform *and* entertain!
- **Think of your slides as resources.** Provide links which people can follow to find out more.
- **Clear contact details.** Make sure that your contact details are conspiciously evident on your first and last slides. Make it easy for people will want to contact you. A Twitter or GitHub handle works best.

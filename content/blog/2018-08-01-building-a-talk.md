IDEA: The other thing I would suggest to your mentee is to pull out a handful of messages the audience should definitely understand by listening to her talk. They could be the purpose of each of the sections or a series of facts that support her main argument. As long as she accomplishes communicating these few things, it's fine if she forgets or miscommunicates the rest. Helps take away some of the pressure

## Choosing a Topic

Talk about something that

- matters to you;
- pleases you;
- interests you; or
- angers or irritates you.

Try to use a personal story.

It all starts with planning.

## Golden Thread

Try to have a single narrative that runs through the entire talk. If you can articulate this idea as a short snappy sentence then you can say it a couple of times during the talk. You can also include it in the abstract.

The Golden Thread will help you to maintain focus.

## Structure Templates

### Problem to be Solved

1. Describe the problem.
2. Illustrative anecdote or story.
3. What's been done about this previously?
4. What's the big new idea?
5. Why will this make a difference?
6. How will this change the future?

DO SAME FOR OTHER GENERAL TOPIC IDEAS

1-What is your question?
2-Why significant?
3-Overview of what is known and gaps in knowledge
4-Approach
5-Progress or challenges
6-Future plans

1. Your problem
2. The deeper problem.
3. A solution found elsewhere (perhaps in another field?)
4. How you can apply this solution
5. How this will work in practice (how effective will it be?)

## Know the Audience

It's very unlikely that you will be able to please the *whole* audience. But aim to address the main body of the distribution. The tails can be very hard to satisfy.

## The Process

Building a talk is an intense creative process. Here are some things you can do to make it as productive as possible:

- Isolation. Find a space where you are not going to get interrupted. Turn off distractions (phone and email).
- Old School. Nothing digital required, this is strictly analog to start (whiteboard or paper, pen and stick notes).
- Go Wide. Brainstorm wildly, looking at all the possible (or potentially even impossible) ways to convey your message.
- Rationalise and Organise. Decide on which ideas you're keeping and arrange them into a logical order.
- Sketch Slides.

## Slides

### Your Message

What is the single thing that you are wanting to convey to the audience? This is the guiding principle for preparing your talk and everything should revolve around achieving it.

### One Idea per Slide

### 10/20/30

@GuyKawasaki's [10/20/30 principle](https://guykawasaki.com/the_102030_rule/): 10 slides, 20 minutes and 30 pt font. A great recipe for a concise and legible #presentation. #publicspeaking 

### How Many Slides? How Much per Slide?

## Planning

A good approach to planning is to sketch out ideas for your talk on paper. A mind map or a flow chart is a good structure. But you don't need to be that rigorous.

A problem with mind maps and complicated flow charts are that they are inherently non-linear. However, basic Physics dictates that your talk needs to be linear. So you need to work out a sequence for the various items that you want to talk about.

## Introduction

Here are some ways to kick off a talk:

- a (short) story;
- a provocative statement;
- a question (or a string of relayed questions); or
- an image, video or sound.

## Start with Why

This is on the brink of becoming a cliché.

TALK ABOUT CORE CONCEPT IN SIMON SINEK'S BOOK "START WITH WHY".

Something that you should try to clarify for your audience as soon as possible is "Why?". Why should they be giving you their undivided attention? Why are you standing up front? Why are you talking about this particular topic?

## Go in with a Bang!

It's important to kick off your talk in such a way that you grab the audience's attention. There are a couple of ways to do this, but here are some ideas that work well for me:

- *Make it personal*. Relate a story that should resonate personally with the audience. You literally want to "hit them where they live". Make it immediately apparent that the content of this talk will be relevant to them.
- *Novelty*. Do or say something unexpected.
- *Challenge the Status Quo*. Make a statement which contradicts conventional wisdom.
- *Humour*. This isn't for everyone, but if you can start with something funny you will immediately win over the audience.

## Content is King

## Context is Queen

While it's vital to have interesting content, it's also important to place this content into a broader context. Why should the audience be interested in what you have to say?

## Stories

Stories are more compelling if you provide vivid details. If necessary you might need to embellish your "plain" story with synthetic details to persuade your audience of it's veracity. Details translate into credibility. This sounds rather superficial, but it works. Help your audience create a mental image of the characters and scences in your story.

## Slides

THIS SHOULD PROBABLY GO IN SEPARATE POST

<blockquote>
	Slides are like the stage in a play or the costume for the actor; they are not themselves the star of the show, but they do provide the context and setting in which you can give a memorable performance.
	<cite>Nancy Duarte, <em>slide:ology</em></cite>
</blockquote>

The entire contents of a slide should be digested by an audience in a few seconds. That way they won't be trying to read all of the text or figure out the intention of the contents instead of listening to you.

What goes on a slide?

- Text and
- Images.

### Background

### Font

<blockquote>
	A good rule of thumb for font size is to divide the oldest investor's age by two, and use that font size.
	<cite>Guy Kawasaki</cite>
</blockquote>

### Colour

### Logos

Nancy Duarte advises that your logo should only appear on the "bumper" slides (first and last).

### Whitespace

<blockquote>
	Generally, any slide that needs to sacrifice whitespace to make room for content is packed too tightly.
	<cite>Nancy Duarte, *slide:ology*</cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	It’s okay to have clear space: clutter is a failure of design.
	<cite>Nancy Duarte, *slide:ology*</cite>
</blockquote>

## Structure

### Start With Why

<div style="max-width:854px"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

Simon Sinek popularised the phrase "start with why".

### Begin with a Question (or Questions)

Posing a few interesting questions is a great way to kick off a talk. It immediately piques the curiosity of the audience and they will be riveted to hear how you unpack the answers.

### Freytag Pyramid

The [Freytag Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure#Freytag.27s_analysis) is a model for dramatic structure that works well for talks.

The pyramid consists of seven (or five, depending on who you ask!) stages.

The most important stages are Exposition, Climax and Dénouement. Start with those. If possible you can try to fill out the other stages too.

- Exposition
- Rising Action
- Complication
- Climax
- Falling Action
- Resolution
- Dénouement

### The Hero's Journey

Don't underplay the problem. I've been inclined to rush through the description of the problem in order to get to the solution as quickly as possible. This is a mistake. Spend time describing the problem. This builds tension and anticipation.

## Visuals

Keep it simple.

Avoid text heavy slides. In fact, if you can, avoid text altogether (with the exception of headings, perhaps).

Don't think of slides as a crutch. They are a mechanism to augment what you have to say. Not the other way around. What you are saying should drive the slides. The slides should not drive the discourse.

## Consider the Audience

While building your talk always consider what you are doing from the perspective of the audience: will they find the material interesting and informative?

## Give the Audience Something

Try to leave the audience with something they can use. This could be:

- a list of resources;
- ??????

## Things to Include

- Why does this matter?
- What are the consequences? What will happen as a result?

## Opening

Good ways to start a talk:

- Ask a question. Or, even better, a series of (related) questions.
- Tell a story.
- State a little known fact.
- Give a pertinent quotation.

The idea of telling a story is not one that comes naturally to me. When I try to think of a personal (and hence original) story to tell I usually find it rather difficult. I don't feel like I have many stories worth telling. But I've learned a trick: you've told numerous stories to your partners, colleagues, friends, parents, siblings and children. Any one of those stories might be a good candidate to tell on stage. Don't underestimate the value of your own experiences.

## Closing

End on a high note!

Options for closing a talk:

- Give a short summary by highlighting your (three is a good number!) main points.
- Present a call to action. What do you want the audience to do now?
- Refer back to the opening. Did you tell a story, state a fact, give a quote or ask a question? Then refer back to it now.

Try to incorporate a call to action.

Make sure that your contact details are repeated on the final slide.

Suggest engaging on Twitter and mention a hashtag.

Examples of powerful endings:

- "Every kid needs a champion" (Rita Pierson). Thanks to Asian Lindsay for bringing this to my attention.

## Depth or Breadth?

It's easy to try and fit everything you know into a single talk.

But this is a mistake.

Your audience will only be able to absorb so much.

You can go deep on a single well defined topic. The scope needs to be narrow and you will need to leave things out to maintain focus.

You can go wide (but shallow) across a range of (preferably related) topics. You need to show how the topics are related (because the audience will be trying to figure this out!) and you still need to limit yourself on the number of topics. Three or five topics work well.

## Live Tweeting Slide

Encourage the audience to live tweet your talk by providing a slide with your Twitter handle and some suggested hastags.

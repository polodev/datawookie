We're kicking off the inaugural meeting of the Durban R Users Group&nbsp;with a live video presentation by [Andrie de Vries](https://twitter.com/revoandrie) (Senior Programme Manager, R Community Projects at Microsoft / Revolution Analytics). Andrie will be talking about "Demonstration of using R in the cloud together with Azure Machine Learning". If you've kept up with Microsoft's recent contributions to R then you'll know that this is going to be an interesting talk.

We'll also have [Professor Bruce Page](http://ukzn.academia.edu/BPage) (University of KwaZulu-Natal, School of Biological and Conservation Sciences) talking about "An Introduction to Spatial Analysis in R", which will cover using the T-LoCoH package for tracking space/time data. Bruce is an recognised expert on monitoring the movements and changes in home ranges of wild animals.

Andrew Collier will give a talk entitled "From Klueless to Kaggle in 15 Minutes" which will demonstrate how you can rapidly get up to speed on Data Analysis and Predictive Modelling in R.

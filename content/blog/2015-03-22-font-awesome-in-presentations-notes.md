title: 'Font Awesome in Presentations: Notes'

I've used various icons from [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) in my last few presentations and I've been very pleased with the results. <!--more--> Using them is pretty straight forward, but here are a couple of things that I picked up:

* copy the icons straight from the [Cheat Sheet](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/); 
* if you are unable to paste the icon (or you just get a little square instead of the eye candy you were expecting), try selecting the "Keep source formatting" option when you paste.

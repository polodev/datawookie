title: The Green Number Effect
---

Following up on a suggestion from my [previous post](http://www.exegetic.biz/blog/2013/06/age-distribution-comrades-athletes/), here are the statistics for medal count versus age. <!--more--> Every point on the plot is the number (see colour legend on right) of athletes who have achieved a given number of medals by a particular age.

There is clear evidence of a Green Number Effect: many people hang on for ten medals and then pack it in. There is also weaker evidence of a Double Green Number Effect. But evidently there are far fewer people with that kind of commitment or level of craziness.

What about the influence of the Back-2-Back medals introduced in 2005? If you look carefully at the plot above then you can see some evidence. However, a simple histogram of medal counts makes the effect irrefutable.

Thanks for the idea, Tilda.

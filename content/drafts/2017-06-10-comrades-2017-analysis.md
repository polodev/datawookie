LOOK AT THIS TOO:

Mark Dowdeswell (@mrdowdeswell) tweeted at 6:40 pm on Sat, Jun 10, 2017: So this turned out to be quite an interesting query. Hopefully I haven't overanalysed it!

I'll kick off with a couple of results from [Mark Dowdeswell](https://twitter.com/mrdowdeswell) as published in [this thread](https://twitter.com/mrdowdeswell/status/872544989166931968/photo/1). He notes that 8.5% of female finishers and 2.2% of male finishers ran negative splits.

@mrdowdeswell also observed that women are more likely than men to run a negative split, regardless of their finishing time.

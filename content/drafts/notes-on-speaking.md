## Checklist

1. Find a topic.
2. Do some research.
3. Write an abstract.
4. Find a suitable conference with an open call for papers.
5. Submit your proposed talk.
6. Wait to hear if you have been accepted.
7. If successful, prepare and deliver your talk. Bask in the glory.

## Finding a Topic

Things to think about:

- Explore some "conventional wisdom". Is it correct? Support your conclusions.
- Can you repurpose an existing tool for another novel application?
- Find out about a new technology.

Your topic needs to be a compromise between

- something that interests you
- something that you know (at least something!) about
- something of interest to the conference organisers and sponsors
- something that's relevant and interesting to the audience.

Choosing a topic that relates to something that is currently considered "sexy" and is creating a lot of hype is also a good strategy.

On what topics do people ask you for advice or help? You are already considered an expert in those domains.

What side project are you working on that everybody else is currently unaware of?

What major challenges have you overcome?

If this was your last chance to share some key knowledge with your familt or colleagues, what would you talk about?

<blockquote>
	The best advice I have ever heard was to create something specifically for someone I know. 

Just one person. 

It's a genius idea. 

Every time I go to create something, or build something I think about who I know that would benefit from what I'm doing. 

If you have something that you care enough about to make, you have to ask the next question — who are you making it for? 

What information do they need? 
What turn of phrase would stop them in their tracks? 

What is their single pain point that the product could solve, or their secret story that your creation would be able to touch and cultivate into a real emotional response? 

Stop thinking about your audience as a vague concept, a collection of faceless people. 

Believe that your audience is a real person with feelings, experiences and a story. It will change your perspective. 
You want people to care? 

Build, write, create, craft and dream — just for them.

## Feedback

Once you have a topic and abstract share them with some friends and colleagues. Get some feedback. Iterate.

## Presentations

More storytelling, less lecturing.

Find ways to differentiate your presentation from others at same event.

## Demonstrations

If you're planning on doing a demonstration then it's worthwhile having a backup plan. This is particularly important if there are dependencies in your demonstration (like networking!).

A good backup plan is to record segments of the demonstration using screen recording software. These recordings can be played back during your talk if the demonstration goes horribly wrong. You can also publish them on YouTube afterwards and link them into a blog post, which will allow you to gain maximum leverage out of your talk preparation.

## Preparation

Unless you are giving a TED talk, don't memorise your talk. It can be helpful to memorise the first few lines though, just to get your started!

## Before You Go on Stage

Try to establish a relationship with a few people in the audience. You can do this by introducing yourself during coffee breaks. You'll then know that there are a few people in the audience who already know you. This will help you feel more at home on the stage (rather than facing a room of complete strangers!).

## The Day Before

Check out the space. Walk around. Get up on stage. Check out the setup. If possible, have a look at the audio equipment.

- Check that you'll be able to easily hook up your laptop. Do they have appropriate cables and adaptors?

Make sure that you are familiar with the surroundings.

Meet the organisers and helpers. Make sure that they know who you are.

### Getting Started

Begin with energy.

Check your posture. Be comfortable.

### Concluding

Final slide should *not* be "Thank You"! You don't need to ingratiate yourself to them. You have just rocked their world. They should be thanking you.

Things you can put on final slide:

- Contact details
- 3 point summary of your talk

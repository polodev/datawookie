An entertaining and thought-provoking talk about creativitity from Adam Grant. He&#8217;s been looking at non-conformists, or &#8220;originals&#8221; as he likes to call them. Originals lie near the sweet spot between [precrastinators][1] and procrastinators. Here are some of their characteristics:

  1. Originals are late to the party. 
      * Originals feel doubt and fear. 
          * Originals have lots of bad ideas. </ol> 
            Some of the findings from his research are surprising and counter-intuitive. Definitely worth taking the time to watch the talk.
  
            Here are a couple of my favouries quotes:
            
            > It&#8217;s much easier to improve on somebody else&#8217;s idea than it is to create something new from scratch. So the lesson I learned is that to be original you don&#8217;t have to be first. You just have to be different and better.<cite>Adam Grant</cite>
            
            > Instead of saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m crap,&#8221; you say, &#8220;The first few drafts are always crap, and I&#8217;m just not there yet.&#8221;<cite>Adam Grant</cite>
            
            What I got out of this talk is the idea that procrastination gives you time to think more about a problem. It could help you produce something outstanding. On the other hand, it could really bite you in the ass.

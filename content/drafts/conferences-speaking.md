## Technical Check

Take advantage of the opportunity for a technical check.

- Get familiar with the stage.
- Make sure your presentation looks okay on the projector. Can you read the font from the back?
- Understand the sound system. Will you need your laptop hooked up to audio?
- Understand the remote control.

Befriend the technical folk. They'll be driving the show on the day.

## Answering Questions

If somebody stands up in the audience and starts pontificating without actually asking a question, then you're perfectly justified in asking them whether they have a question and if not then moving on.

Don't feel ashamed to admit that you don't know the answer.

## Performance

As much as giving a talk is about performing, it's also about connecting with the audience. The most effective way to do this is to thing about having a conversation with the audience (albeit a very one sided conversation). Try to use a conversational tone.

"The two-hour marathon: who and when?" by Joyner et al. --- Have copy in Mendeley

Data were scraped from the [marathon world record progression][1] at Wikipedia.

I&#8217;ve recently become a rapid proponent of [Plotly][2], so here&#8217;s the obligatory interactive plot.

The plot only shows times recognised by the IAAF.



XXX of the XXX times that the Marathon World Record has been broken in recent years it has happened at the Berlin Marathon. What&#8217;s so special about this race? There are a few key factors which make the Berlin Marathon course suited to fast times: it&#8217;s flat and, with only a relatively small number of corners, twists or turns, it&#8217;s also pretty straight. The Berlin Marathon also takes place in early Autumn, which means moderate temperatures with low wind.

According to [Ross Tucker][3] the number of star athletes in the field can have an effect on the likelihood of a new world record. Somewhat counter to intuition, the more elite athletes there are, the less likely it is that a record will be broken. And racing tactics are to blame: none of the guys up front want to pull somebody else through to a new record time. Ideally there should be just a couple of top runners who are committed to working together to make a new record time.

Personally I find a flat course pretty taxing because you have to work hard all the way. No downhill to recuperate. But, then again, these guys are in a different league altogether and they are likely to be working damn hard every inch of the way.

INCORPORATE NOTES-ON-SPEAKING DOCUMENT

It's important to care about your topic. You need to *want* to talk about it! You need to *want* to convey this information to the audience. And people in the audience are smart: they will pick up on a lack of enthusiasm.

Here are some options. Talk about

- a subject where you are an expert (or at least more expert than most of the audience);
- your experience learning a new technology (one of my favourites!);
- lessons you have learned (in any domain!);
- a contrarian view on some popular opinion or urban legend (but presented in a positive light!);
- bring a new perspective to an old topic.

## Know Your Target

Ideally you want to choose a topic which is aligned with the theme and objectives of the conference. You also need to get inside the heads of the audience and figure out whether what you want to say would be personally interesting to them. What are their interest? What is their technical background? What is the common denominator?

Where does this information come from? Well, if this is not the first instance of a conference then you can check out the web pages and programmes for previous instances and infer what topics have been presented. You'll probably also be able to glean a lot more information from these too with some careful inspection. Have a look for mentions of the conference in social media (Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook are particularly fruitful for this information). Many conferences make videos of their talks available too. Take a look at some of those.

It might also be a good idea to just ping the conference organisers. The odds are good that they'll be happy to provide you with the information you need. Although, be warned, they will be busy people so don't waste their time: be polite and succinct.

Conference web pages will often publish suggested themes and track descriptions which can act as a guideline.

Although it's good to be more or less aligned with the stated themes and objectives of the conference, there's no harm in pushing the boundaries slightly and proposing something a little edgy.

## Tips

- Look to previously accepted talks for inspiration (these are just a guideline, mind you: you still need to come up with something more or less original).

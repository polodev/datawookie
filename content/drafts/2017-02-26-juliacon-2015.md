Although I was not able to attend [JuliaCon 2015][1] (24-27 June 2015, MIT), I&#8217;ve been able to follow along online. Fortunately there&#8217;s a [YouTube playlist][2] with videos for many of the talks. Below is a curated selection of talks which I found particularly interesting.

### Avik Sengupta: A practical guide to exposing Julia APIs on the web



### Jacob Quinn: Managing Data in Julia Old Tricks, New Tricks



## Applications

Kyle Barbary gave a talk entitled [JuliaAstro][3]. Although Python is becoming the _lingua franca_ of Astronomy it can be slow! Doing comparable calculations in Julia can be massively faster. There are already a number of Julia packages for doing things relating to Astronomy, particularly those written by the author portmanteau [Julia Astro][4].

> &#8230; you&#8217;ve got to remember that the story is much more about the audience than it is about the characters or the plot. And it is much more about the audience than it is about the storyteller.<cite>Julian Friedmann</cite>

> Actually then, Aristotle described the formula. He did that two and a half thousand years ago. Not only did it work then, it still works today. So actually anyone who says there is no formula is wrong, there is. Aristotle did it in a way that makes it incredibly easy to remember. There’s three words – pity, fear and catharsis. He said you need to make the audience feel pity for a character. You do that usually by making the character go through some undeserved misfortune. What that does – it enables the audience to emotionally connect with the character. And once the writer has got that emotional connection between the audience and the character, the writer begins to have some control over the audience. You then put the character into a worse and worse and worse situation. And because of the emotional connection, the identification, the audience feels fear. When you release the character from the jeopardy or whatever the situation they’re in, the audience experiences a catharsis. Pity, fear, catharsis.

> But just so you can see that this is not specific to a two and a half thousand year old Greek. I found in the program notes of a series of Beethoven concerts given by Maurizio Pollini, a very interesting quote. “Beethoven’s preference for happy endings is not by any means a tendency towards kitsch, but rather a musical style akin to Schiller’s philosophy of struggle, suffering and overcoming.” So you can see the pattern. Struggle, suffering and overcoming – pity, fear, catharsis – beginning, middle and end. It works. It’s always worked and it always will work.

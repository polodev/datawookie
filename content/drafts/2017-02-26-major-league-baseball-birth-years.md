> To put it in more precise terms, for every thousand Americans, there were 29.5 babies born in 1915; 18.7 babies born in 1935; and 24.1 babies born in 1950. The decade of the 1930s is what is called a &#8220;demographic trough.&#8221; In response to the economic hardship of the Depression, families simply stopped having children, and as a result, the generation born during that decade was markedly smaller than both the generation that preceded it and the generation that immediately followed it.

The low point in the early 1930s is accounted for by what Malcolm Gladwell refers to as the &#8220;demographic trough&#8221; caused by the Great Depression.

> 
> Baseball gained more and more popularity from the start until the 1920s &#8212; this would explain the sharp incline up to 1890 (keeping in mind that most players would be 20-30 years old). It&#8217;s strange that there were as many baseball players born in 1890 as in 1960, even though there were more teams in 1960. My thought is that in the early days (i.e., the 1910s) baseball was not typically a full-time occupation, so teams would sign lots of players that didn&#8217;t play very long, or played part-time.

> Apparently the Great Depression reduced baseball&#8217;s popularity quite a bit (people had other things to worry about, after all). In the early 1930s most all baseball owners cut their rosters from 25 to 23 players. World War II in the early 40s also took a lot of potential baseball players.

> So while I&#8217;m not quite sure about the peak around 1890, I think the successive decline is the result of the Great Depression. A temporary increase in baseball interest (as the nation was recovering from the great depression, but not in WWII yet) in the late 1930s could have caused the peak around the 1916 birth date before the U.S. entered the war and lots of young men were drafted, causing the decline after 1916.
> 
> The steady increase after 1940 makes sense to me. More teams certainly came along throughout the 20th century. Baseball became more and more prominent. To answer your last question, I would say yes to both. There are more teams today than ever before. Also, today there is a sophisticated &#8220;Farm League&#8221; for developing young players. Throughout the season, these minor league players can be &#8220;called up&#8221; to the majors. In addition, in the final month of the season, each major league team gets to move from a 25 man roster to a 40 man roster. More people make it to the mlb these days than ever before.

> I will do a little more research, but my first thought about the steady increase in the last however many years is due to a new style of team management. What I mean by this is teams seem to keep a lot of players in their minor league teams. Then, they call these players up for one or two games just to test them out. This would officially render them major league players, and thus they would be counted in this statistic. This seems to be done more often, but that&#8217;s just speculation really. I&#8217;ll look into it a little more and get back to you.

Thoughts on building this talk:

- associate each section with one of the monsters on Homer's Odyssey (Cyclops, Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis)

I have three versions of the proposal for this talk. I like the rambling versions because they make greater use of the Odyssey theme, but I'm using the concise version for the moment because the others still need to polished.

## Concise Version

<div class="talk">
<div class="title">
Solidity: An Ethereum Odyssey
</div>
<div class="abstract" markdown="1">
*Odyssey: an eventful journey usually marked by many changes of fortune.* This is the story of my eventful journey to understand Solidity, a language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

The Ethereum Odyssey has three main challenges:

1. What is a smart contract? I’ll start with a basic introduction to smart contracts and the Ethereum blockchain, skimping on the theoretical details but focusing on what you need to know for practical applications.
2. What tools do I need? There’s a bewildering array of tooling. I’ll show you how to assemble a minimal complete development environment.
3. How do I create my own smart contract? I’ll unpack basic Solidity syntax and show you how to write, build, test and deploy smart contracts of your own.

By the end of the talk you’ll have a solid understanding of what a smart contract is all about. You’ll also know what tools you need, and be able to code and deploy a smart contract. You’ll be completely ready to start your own epic Ethereum Odyssey.

Solidity: An Ethereum Odyssey
</div>
<div class="abstract" markdown="1">
Odyssey: an eventful journey usually marked by many changes of fortune. This is the story of my eventful journey to understand Solidity, a language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

The talk will give an introduction to the concepts and techniques behind smart contracts. It’ll cover everything you need to construct a complete (but minimal!) development environment. You’ll also get a solid understanding of basic Solidity syntax and how to write, build, test and deploy smart contracts of your own.
</div>
<div class="description" markdown="1">
Solidity is a robust and exciting name for a programming language. If I was about to embark on an interplanetary odyssey, I’d definitely call my ship “Solidity”.

Solidity is also the language of choice for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. I set out to discover these technologies. The voyage was challenging, but not because of interference from a meddling computer. Nor from understanding hashing or cryptography, the tricky theoretical details behind the blockchain. The biggest obstacle was figuring out how all of the diverse pieces of technology clamped together and communicated with each other.

There’s a lot of information available online to get you started with Solidity. However, it’s evolving rapidly and much of this information is already obsolete. Or completely impenetrable. I would have eaten the monolith for this Odyssey Starter Kit:

- a high level description of the major concepts;
- links to help you dig deeper;
- setup instructions for a minimal set of tools;
- illuminating examples; and
- detailed instructions on how to get it all working together.

This is precisely what I will deliver in this talk. By the end you’ll have a solid idea of what a smart contract is all about, you’ll know what tools you need and be able to code and deploy a simple smart contract onto the Ethereum blockchain. You’ll be completely ready to start your own Blockchain Odyssey (with or without a villainous semi-sentient computer for company).

The talk will be suitable for the entire spectrum of geeks. A rudimentary knowledge of JavaScript will be helpful, but by no means mandatory.

Solidity is a sturdy name for a programming language. If I was about to embark on an Interstellar Odyssey, then I’d definitely call my ship “Solidity”.

Solidity is also the language of choice for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. I set out to discover these technologies. The voyage was challenging, with a selection of mythical monsters (Cyclops, Sirens and Charybdis to name but a few). However, somewhat surprisingly, these challenges did not come from understanding hashing or cryptography, the theoretical details behind the blockchain. The biggest obstacle was figuring out how all of the diverse bits of technology fitted together and talked to each other.

There’s a lot of information available online to get you started on the journey. However, Solidity and the associated tools are evolving rapidly and much of this information is already obsolete. Or completely impenetrable.

I would have slayed Scylla for this Odyssey Starter Kit:

- a high level description of the major concepts;
- links to help you dig deeper;
- setup instructions for a minimal set of tools;
- illuminating examples; and
- detailed instructions on how to get it all working together.

This is precisely what I will deliver in this talk.
